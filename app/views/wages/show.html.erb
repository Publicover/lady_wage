  You said you're making <strong><%= number_to_currency(@wage.annual_wage) %></strong> per project,<br />
  but you should be making <strong><%= number_to_currency(man_wage(@wage.annual_wage)) %></strong>.
  <br />
  <h3 id='show-difference'>That's a difference of <%= number_to_currency(show_difference(man_wage(@wage.annual_wage), @wage.annual_wage)) %>.</h3>
  <h5>That means you're missing out on about
    <%= number_to_currency(show_difference(man_wage(@wage.annual_wage), @wage.annual_wage) * @wage.projects_per_year) %> per year.</h5>
